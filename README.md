The code has been developed and tested in a conda environment running Python v3.10 with the following packages installed:
ipython, ipykernel, iris (v3.11), nc-time-axis, netcdf4, pandas, scipy, seaborn and xarray.

The script requires three arguments: 
diag_name [currently accepted options are: JSI_sh_ERA5', 'JLI_sh_ERA5', 'SMB_MARv3.12', 'SMB_HIRHAM5', 'SMB_all', 'zw3index_SH_mag_ERA5', 'zw3index_SH_phase_ERA5', 'U_10hPa_55-65S', 'Ross_gyre', 'Weddell_gyre', 'ACC_transport', 'blockingP90_150â€“90W', 'AR_eant_IWV', 'AR_eant_IVT', 'AR_want_IWV', 'AR_want_IVT' and 'SAM_marshall']
mean_period [currently accepted options are 'monthly' or 'seasonal']
update_data ['1' to update and '0' to not update]

An example of running the script in ipython: 
In [1]: run aci_plot.py 'SAM_marshall' 'monthly' 0

Input time series data for the plotting are contained in the directory 't_srs' and its subdirectories. 
Other data required for plotting, such as logo graphics, are located in the directory 'plotting_info'.
Plots generated by the Python script are stored in the directory 'plots'.
